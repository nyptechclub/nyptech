## Thank you for your support!

On 17th May 2024, we successfully held our inaugural event with a full house at the School of Information Technology (SIT). Graced by our esteemed guests from the Innovation and Enterprise Office (IEO), lecturers, student clubs, and our star-studded panel of alumni entrepreneurs, NYP Link proved to be an exciting afternoon of learning.

_Ever heard an AI virtual assistant with a Singaporean accent?_

Our very own student entrepreneurs, Jet and Wei Heng, seized the opportunity to share their startup, Procolink with the audience. Their product provides 24/7 technical support to customers through the use of AI voice calls. They have successfully attained a grant of $10,000 through the NYP IEO’s Jumpstart Programme.
